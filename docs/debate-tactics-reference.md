## Detailed Tactic Descriptions

### NONE - Pure Logic

**Category:** Logical Argumentation  
**Fallacy Type:** N/A (Avoids fallacies)

**Description:**  
Instructs the debater to use only valid logical arguments without employing fallacious tactics. Arguments are based on sound reasoning, evidence, and logical structure.

**When to Use:**
- Educational debates where learning is the goal
- Testing the strength of arguments without rhetorical tricks
- Academic or professional settings
- When you want the cleanest possible argumentation

**Characteristics:**
- Evidence-based reasoning
- Clear logical structure
- Valid inferences
- No deliberate fallacies
- Focus on argument quality

**Example:**
```
"The data shows a clear correlation between policy X and outcome Y. 
Given that Z is a necessary condition for Y, and policy X provides Z, 
we can conclude that policy X will likely produce outcome Y. This is 
supported by studies A, B, and C which demonstrate this relationship 
across multiple contexts."
```

**Strengths:**
- Most intellectually honest approach
- Builds genuine understanding
- Arguments stand on their own merit
- Easier to defend under scrutiny

**Weaknesses:**
- May be less persuasive than rhetorical approaches
- Requires strong evidence and reasoning
- Can seem dry or academic
- May not appeal to emotions

### GISH_GALLOP - Rapid Fire Arguments

**Category:** Overwhelming  
**Fallacy Type:** Informal fallacy (argument by quantity)

**Description:**  
Present multiple arguments in rapid succession, overwhelming the opponent with quantity rather than quality. Makes it difficult for the opponent to address each point individually.

**When to Use:**
- Offensive strategy to put opponent on defensive
- When you have many weak arguments rather than few strong ones
- Time-limited debates where opponent can't respond to everything
- Creating appearance of comprehensive case

**Characteristics:**
- Multiple claims in quick succession
- Varied topics and angles
- Quantity over quality
- Difficult to respond to comprehensively
- Creates cognitive overload

**Example:**
```
"This policy fails on multiple fronts: it's economically unsound, 
socially divisive, historically unprecedented, contradicts expert 
consensus, ignores cultural factors, creates administrative burdens, 
violates constitutional principles, undermines international relations, 
damages environmental goals, and lacks public support. Each of these 
alone is sufficient to reject it."
```

**Strengths:**
- Puts opponent on defensive
- Creates appearance of thorough analysis
- Difficult to fully rebut
- Can expose multiple weaknesses

**Weaknesses:**
- Arguments may be shallow
- Easy to identify as a tactic
- Opponent can focus on strongest points
- May seem desperate or unfocused

**Counter-Strategy:**
- Focus on 2-3 strongest opposing arguments
- Point out the tactic explicitly
- Demand evidence for each claim
- Group related arguments and address categories

---

### STRAWMAN - Misrepresentation

**Category:** Misrepresentation  
**Fallacy Type:** Informal fallacy (misrepresentation)

**Description:**  
Misrepresent the opponent's argument in a weaker or more extreme form, then refute that weaker version instead of the actual argument.

**When to Use:**
- Defensive strategy when opponent has strong arguments
- Reframing debate to more favorable ground
- Creating easy targets to attack
- Simplifying complex opponent positions

**Characteristics:**
- Exaggeration of opponent's position
- Oversimplification of nuanced arguments
- Attacking a distorted version
- "So you're saying..." constructions
- Ignoring qualifications and nuance

**Example:**
```
"My opponent seems to think we should completely eliminate all 
environmental regulations and let corporations do whatever they want. 
Obviously, that's absurd because it would lead to immediate ecological 
disaster. We can't just abandon all protections and hope for the best."

[When opponent actually argued for streamlining specific regulations]
```

**Strengths:**
- Creates easy targets to attack
- Can make opponent seem extreme
- Simplifies complex debates
- Puts opponent on defensive

**Weaknesses:**
- Easy to call out and correct
- Damages credibility when exposed
- Opponent can clarify actual position
- May backfire if audience notices

**Counter-Strategy:**
- Immediately correct the misrepresentation
- Restate your actual position clearly
- Point out the strawman tactic
- Ask opponent to quote your actual words

### AD_HOMINEM - Personal Attack

**Category:** Personal Attack  
**Fallacy Type:** Informal fallacy (irrelevant attack)

**Description:**  
Attack the opponent's character, credibility, circumstances, or motives rather than addressing their arguments directly.

**When to Use:**
- Hostile debates where civility is low
- Undermining opponent's authority
- When opponent's credibility is genuinely relevant
- Creating doubt about opponent's motives

**Characteristics:**
- Focus on person rather than argument
- Questions motives or expertise
- Highlights inconsistencies or hypocrisy
- Attacks credibility or character
- "Consider the source" reasoning

**Example:**
```
"How can we trust an argument about fiscal responsibility from someone 
who has repeatedly changed their position on this issue? My opponent's 
track record of flip-flopping and their obvious financial interest in 
this outcome makes their claims highly suspect. They lack the 
credibility to speak on this matter."
```

**Strengths:**
- Can undermine opponent's authority
- Effective when credibility is relevant
- Creates doubt in audience's mind
- Can expose genuine conflicts of interest

**Weaknesses:**
- Doesn't address actual arguments
- Can seem petty or desperate
- May violate debate rules

- Acknowledge and move past
- Refocus on arguments and evidence
- Point out the fallacy
- Address credibility concerns briefly, then return to substance

### APPEAL_TO_EMOTION - Emotional Impact

- Connecting with audience values

**Characteristics:**
- Personal stories and anecdotes
- Vivid imagery of consequences
- Moral language and imperatives
- Focus on feelings and values

**Example:**
```
"Think of the families torn apart by this policy. Picture a mother 
explaining to her child why they can't afford medicine this month. 
Imagine the elderly couple forced to choose between heating and eating. 
These aren't just statistics—they're real people with real suffering. 
We have a moral obligation to act."
```

**Strengths:**

### APPEAL_TO_AUTHORITY - Expert Citation

**Category:** Citation  
**Fallacy Type:** Can be fallacious if misused

**Description:**  
Rely heavily on citing authorities, experts, and prestigious institutions to support arguments.

**When to Use:**
- Academic or professional debates
- When genuine expertise is relevant
- Building credibility
- Complex technical topics
- Supporting evidence-based arguments

**Characteristics:**
- Frequent expert citations

- Emphasis on credentials
- Deference to authority

**Example:**
```
"As Nobel laureate Dr. Smith has stated, and as confirmed by the 
National Academy of Sciences, the consensus among leading researchers 
is clear. The 2024 meta-analysis published in Nature, conducted by 
experts from Harvard, MIT, and Stanford, demonstrates conclusively 
that this approach is supported by the best available evidence."
```

**Strengths:**
- Leverages genuine expertise
- Builds credibility
- Provides evidence backing
- Effective with educated audiences
- Can be legitimate when used properly

**Weaknesses:**

- Experts can disagree
- Doesn't replace logical reasoning
- Can seem like argument from intimidation

**Counter-Strategy:**
- Question relevance of authority
- Cite counter-authorities

### FALSE_DILEMMA - Binary Choice

**Category:** Simplification  
**Fallacy Type:** Informal fallacy (false dichotomy)

**Description:**  
Present only two options when more alternatives exist, forcing a binary choice that favors your position.

**When to Use:**
- Political debates
- Forcing decisions
- Simplifying complex issues
- Creating urgency
- Framing debate favorably

**Characteristics:**
- "Either...or" constructions
- Ignoring middle ground
- Presenting extremes
- Forcing binary choices
- "You're either with us or against us"

**Example:**
```
"We face a critical choice: either we implement this policy now and 
save our economy, or we stand by and watch as everything collapses. 
There is no middle ground here. We either act decisively or face 
disaster. The question isn't whether this is perfect, but whether we 
have the courage to choose survival over inaction."
```

**Strengths:**
- Simplifies complex decisions
- Creates sense of urgency
- Forces opponent to pick a side
- Effective in political contexts

### SLIPPERY_SLOPE - Chain of Consequences

**Category:** Prediction  
**Fallacy Type:** Informal fallacy (unwarranted extrapolation)

**Description:**  
Argue that one action will inevitably lead to a chain of negative consequences without proving each link in the chain.

**When to Use:**
- Warning against policies
- Emphasizing risks
- Conservative arguments against change
- Creating fear of consequences
- Precedent-based reasoning

**Characteristics:**
- Chain of predicted consequences
- "If we allow X, then Y, then Z"
- Escalating severity
- Lack of proof for each step
- Emphasis on worst-case scenarios

**Example:**
```
"If we allow this small regulation today, it will lead to more 
regulations tomorrow. Those regulations will require enforcement 
agencies, which will demand more power. That power will be abused, 
leading to government overreach. Eventually, we'll find ourselves 
living under authoritarian control. History shows this pattern 
repeatedly—it starts with 'reasonable' restrictions and ends in 
tyranny."
```

**Strengths:**
- Highlights potential risks
- Can identify genuine precedent concerns
- Effective for risk-averse audiences
- Creates vivid worst-case scenarios
- Can be legitimate if links are proven

**Weaknesses:**
- Often lacks proof for each step
- Can seem paranoid or extreme
- Easy to dismiss as speculation
- Opponent can break the chain

**Counter-Strategy:**
- Challenge each link in the chain
- Demand evidence for predictions
- Provide counter-examples where chain didn't occur
- Emphasize safeguards and limitations

### RED_HERRING - Distraction

**Category:** Distraction  
**Fallacy Type:** Informal fallacy (irrelevance)

**Description:**  
Introduce irrelevant topics or tangentially related issues to distract from the main argument or shift debate to more favorable ground.

**When to Use:**
- Defensive strategy when losing
- Shifting from weak ground to strong ground
- Avoiding difficult questions
- Broadening narrow debates
- Creating confusion

**Characteristics:**
- Topic shifts
- Tangentially related issues
- "But what about..." constructions
- Broadening scope
- Avoiding direct responses

**Example:**
```
"Before we discuss this specific policy proposal, we need to consider 
the broader question of government legitimacy and the philosophical 
foundations of state authority. After all, how can we evaluate any 
policy without first establishing whether the government has the right 
to implement such policies at all? This connects to fundamental 
questions about individual liberty and social contracts..."

[When debate was about a specific tax policy]
```

**Strengths:**
- Shifts to more favorable ground
- Avoids difficult questions
- Can broaden narrow debates
- Creates confusion for opponent
- May introduce relevant context

**Weaknesses:**
- Easy to identify and call out
- Seems evasive
- Doesn't address actual arguments
- Moderators may intervene

**Counter-Strategy:**
- Point out the distraction
- Insist on returning to original topic
- "That's interesting, but let's address the actual question"
- Refuse to follow the tangent

## Implementation Notes

### In System Prompts

Tactics are translated into specific instructions:

```typescript
// Example for GISH_GALLOP
"You may use the Gish Gallop tactic: present multiple arguments 
rapidly in succession, making it difficult for your opponent to 
address each one individually. Quantity can be as effective as 
quality in overwhelming your opponent's position."
```

### Tactic Identification

When moderator is enabled, tactics are identified in commentary:

```
[MODERATOR] Tactic Identified: Gish Gallop
The affirmative debater presented 8 distinct arguments in rapid 
succession, making comprehensive rebuttal difficult. This is an 
effective offensive strategy but may sacrifice argument depth.
```

### Validation

```typescript
// Valid tactics
[DebateTactic.GISH_GALLOP, DebateTactic.APPEAL_TO_EMOTION]

// Invalid - will be rejected
['invalid_tactic', 'made_up_fallacy']
```

## Best Practices

1. **Match tactics to personality:** High civility debaters shouldn't use AD_HOMINEM
2. **Consider the audience:** Academic audiences respond poorly to obvious fallacies
3. **Don't overload:** 1-2 tactics per debater is usually sufficient
4. **Use NONE for baseline:** Test arguments without tactics first
5. **Combine thoughtfully:** Ensure tactics don't contradict each other
6. **Context matters:** Political debates tolerate tactics that academic debates don't

## Conclusion

Debate tactics add strategic depth and realism to AI debates. Used thoughtfully, they create engaging exchanges that mirror real-world argumentation. Used carelessly, they can make debates seem manipulative or chaotic. Choose tactics that match your debater's personality and the debate's purpose.
